See the top of the injections/reboot-if.sh script to see how that server can be used.

Basically it sets up a TCP port so you can reboot or shutdown your machine.

Effectively you could do this through ssh as well, since we have already gone through the trouble of setting it up.

If you don't want it simply don't execute the inject-reboot.sh script.
