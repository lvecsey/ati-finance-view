Assemble an x86_64 boot image for a trading system (multiple screens.)

Phase I is for the init script to just boot to a /bin/bash prompt

so you can explore the types of network interfaces and video cards that

are present. You would do this with a physically attached keyboard and

run commands like `lspci` and `lspci -v` to see what's up.

--

Phase II has your network drivers loaded and you can ssh into the machine, 

reboot, or shutdown the system remotely.

--

Phase III has your Xorg configuration dialed in and you're ready to run

some applications.

--

So as you can see, if you are dealing with new hardware you will have to

step through carefully from Phase I, potentially spending a lot of time

in Phase I. But as you gain familiarity (and as this software kit improves)

and use identicial or nearly identical hardware for replicating some of

your stations, you'll be able to skip ahead to the other phases when

setting up a machine.

PREPARATION

--

create

Start off with enough storage space and then as root run the create script,

to pull in a GNU/Linux system with a base set of libraries. It targets

the directory path specified in the env/bd file and pretty much obliterates

the target, including any custimzations you may have had.

--

inject sshd

The next useful step, is to run the inject-sshd.sh script by first

having your public key file in injections/authorized_keys2

example: cp $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub injections/authorized_keys2

That assumes that you have already run `ssh -keygen -t dsa` or similar

in the personal or service account from which you will be ssh'ing into 

the machine.

--

inject init

The init script is a bit specific to the kernel modules it loads, but

critically the dhclient and sshd server will start if the prior boot phases

have gone well. 

--

inject reboot

--

inject modules

actually, you need this stage to probably load your network driver.

You won't actually ssh in without it.

--

inject xorg

--

Finish by running the remake script to generate in actual initrd.img

To run it, you need to configure that path and name of the output image.

Put it it env/output_img and then run the script.

A good location might be something like: /srv/tftp/initrds/lucid-ati-finance-view.img
