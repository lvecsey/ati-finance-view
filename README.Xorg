You want to use the xrandr approach for the ATI drivers since MergedFB is no longer in use for radeon.

The concept is to just start Xorg and after a few seconds when things have stabilized, run the xrandr statement

to rejuggle the screens.

After the new configuration has stabilized, run synergyc.
