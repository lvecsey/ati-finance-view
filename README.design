Part of the philosophy is to finely tune an initrd image and pxelinux boot combination for your specific instance,

so that at boot time when everything unpacks properly you have been for the most part restored to a known good state.

Certain large applications generally still have to be pulled in post-boot, or they make sense to do then due to updates.
